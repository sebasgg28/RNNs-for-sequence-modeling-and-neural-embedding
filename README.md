# RNNs for sequence modeling and neural embedding
 
* Please note, due to the nature of RNN's being a computational demanding algorithm, most of the code was trained though Google Colab and results shown in the Jupiter Notebook.

## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to classify questions based on 6 categories using RNN and tunning different parameters to see how it affects the accuracy. In the data set there are 5,500 questions that may belong to any of the following categories:

- abbreviation (ABBR), 
- entity (ENTY), 
- description (DESC), 
- human (HUM), 
- location (LOC) and 
- numeric (NUM)

It was also tested weather the algorithm would have better accuracy using LSTM and GRU.

At the end 98.74% accuracy was achieved for the training dataset which is impressive.
